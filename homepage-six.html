			<h2>Solving A Problem with javascript functions</h2>
			<pre>

	Download these files into <b>your</b> project folder.
	
	Drag and drop target.html into /html
		      target.js   into /js
		</pre>
		<p>Please link this html file somewhere in your homepage so you can navigate to it easily!</p>

		<hr>
		<pre>
		The only control you have is with the target.js file.
		</pre>
		<hr>
		<pre>
		Open your target.html page - notice that there are two buttons.
		I have preconfigured the reset button.
		Your task today is solving this problem:
		
		How can we program the Target Button so that every time you press the target button, 
		the green square moves closer to the red square?
		
		The approach that I would like you to try to take today invovles some math, but most importantly it involves logic!
		</pre>
		<hr>
		<pre>
		Here is an example:
		
		If (it is raining) :
			I will wear a raincoat today.
		Else
			I will wear a spring jacket today!
		</pre>
		<hr>

		<div>
		<pre>
		Now the end goal is to get the green square to move to a position that the red square is in.
		
		I did not specify that you need to do this with just javascript.
		
		If this is boring or difficult for you - try hacking the code and creating buttons to move the square around for you
		
		**hint add buttons with onclick="move_up()"
