			<h2>Starting Programming with Javascript!</h2>
			<h4>What you have acheived so far (or are currently working toward):</h4>
				<pre>
					0. You are all caught up to the tutorials:
					1. All of your navigation links work
					2. CSS is applied correctly to all of your pages
					3. All of your html is valid when you copy and paste your code to the <a href="https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input">validator.</a>
				</pre>
			<h4>And here is a list of things that I wished you might learn by doing those things:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>You can check if your html syntax is valid by using the <a href="https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input">validator.</a></li>
				<li>CSS can be applied to elements by referencing them in your stylesheet; ex.
				body {
					background-image: url("paper.jpg");
				}
				</li>
				<li>The way a website is made up is entirely dependant on linking each of the pages to each other to create a web like structure!</li>
			</ul>
			<hr>
			<h4>Today's directive is to start working on a simple shape that moves based on user input!</h4>
			<pre>
				Let's get started with creating a new page, and linking it to your homepage.
				If you don't really know how to do this yet; <a href="homepage-three.html">click here.</a>
				It's okay if you need to follow this guide again, it's normal for programmers to refer to old documents.
				
				Please name your new page: animations.
			</pre>
			<hr>
			<h4>Once the following is completed please move on </h4>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Navigate from your homepage to animations</li>
				<li>Navigate from your animations page to your homepage</li>
				<li>You've linked your home.css style to your animations page (notice how you don't need to copy any code, just link the existing file)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Please put your hand up so that Mr.C can verify before moving on.<p>
			<hr>
			<pre>
			This is what I am hoping for you to achieve <a href="jumping_for_js.html">jump for javascript!.</a>
			</pre>
			
			<pre>
			What I want you to do now, is copy this animation to your animation.html page so that it works exactly like the example given.
				1. Create a new page named animations.html
				2. The contents of animations.html should be exactly the same as jumping_for_js.html (except the links are relative to your website)
				3. The animations.html should reference home.js It's how you will get the animations to work
			</pre>
			
			<p>Once you've done this, I want you to play with the html and javascript. Don't edit MR.C's jumping_for_js.html page</p>
			<pre>
				Here are some challenges that you can try to do.
					1. Change the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_shapes.asp">shape.</a></li>
					2. Edit how speedy the button presses are
					3. Try to map a different button, or add more buttons
					4. Remove the collision detection so that the shape goes anywhere on the screen
					5. Change the backgrounds
