	A very step by step tutorial to make a shape change!
			
		** Name these files whatever you like - just be sure to reference them properly **
	
		1. Create a new .html file put this file in your /html folder
		
		2. Create a new .css file put this file in your /css folder

		3. Create a new .js file put this file in your /js folder

		4. Inside your .html file, link your files you just created - together.
		
			place this html to include a javascript file:
			
			
			&lt;script src="<span style="color: #0000a0">../js/$replace_this_name.js</span>"&gt;  
			
			
			Include this inside the body of your .html file.
			
		5. Here is the code to include a css file.
		
			
			&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="<span style="color: #0000a0">../css/$replace_this_name.css</span>"&gt;  

			
		6. In your .html page create a div element that will house your shape that has a recognizable identifier.
		
			Now remember your id, you will need to reference it in your javascript (js) file.
			
			&lt;div id="<span style="color: #f803fc">$my_div_vareiable_id</span>" class="square" onclick="<span style="color: #0000a0">change_shape();</span>"&gt;Delete me! &lt;/div&gt;
			
																									*notice the function name!*
			
		7. Now copy just the css of a bunch of different css shapes using <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_shapes.asp">html shapes</a>
		
			The css for the square looks like this:
			
				.square {
				  height: 50px;
				  width: 50px;
				  background-color: #555;
				}
			
			Copy your css definitions for shapes into your css file.
			
		8. Now get the name of the class of each of the shapes you just copied.
			
					for square, the class name is square
					for circle, the class name is circle,
					etc..
					
		9. You are going to reference every name you copied in a data structure called an array.
				
			Here is how it will work!
			
			["square", "circle", "oval", "addmore" , "using commas"]
		
		10. Now in your js file; declare a function named change_shape()
		
		    function change_shape()
			{
				//This is where your code for this function goes.
			}
		
		11. Notice in your shape element that, onclick="change_shape();"
			
				This means that every time the shape is clicked, your function - and therefore your code is executed.
		
		12. In your function define a variable that you will always use -- your id;
		
				var id = "<span style="color: #f803fc">$my_div_vareiable_id</span>"
		
		13. The next variable that we will define will be the array mentioned earlier.
		
				var array = ["square", "circle", "oval", "addmore" , "using commas"];
		
		14. Next use your id to reference the shape element to get the current class.: 
		
					var current_class = document.getElementById(id).className;

		
		15. Get the position of the current class name in your array
				
				**Note arrays index start at 0, so in our array square is in position 0.**
				
					var current_position = array.indexOf(current_class);

		
		16. Now: here is where we need to figure out if we are at the end of the array or not.
			
			If we are at the end of the array, loop back to 0, else go to the next position.
			
					if (current_position &lt; array.length){
						current_position++;
					} else {
						current_position = 0;
					}
					
		17. Now we will clear the class of the shape, and replace it with the next element from our array.
		
			document.getElementById(id).className  = array[current_position];

		
		Next steps after you've create a clickable chanageble shape:
		
			- Create your own shapes that you define in the css file - don't forget to add them to your js array
			- Choose a random shape to pick
			- Make your shape look like it's rotating!
