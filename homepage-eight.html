	<pre>
	To show off at least one thing that we learned over the course of coding club
	
				<a href="showcase.html">Showcase!</a>
	
	Here you will host all the code to your website, and those of your fellow 2025 coding club atendees!
	
	The way that this will work is that each of you will be assigned two coding club members;
		The person to your left and the person to your right
	
	There are a few critera other than making the site just work and those are;
	
	Each has to feature something that you've learned
	
	and each site links specifically to each of your partners
			(this is how the site will be linked)
			
	So this means: 
	
		- You can make your site into anything you want
		
		- Your home-site will have at least two different places to link.
		
		- From now on focus only on the code inside your folder.
		
		- Only your index.html page needs to have these references
		
		- Feel free to link your working projects into your index.html to show them off!
		
		- You can do as much or as little as you like.
		
		- We're going to start with just your index.html page
		
		- Add some styles and try to explain why someone is looking at the page
		
			(or just try to grab their attention a bit!)
